i have begun rewriting launcher.py as musicSort.py (i should rename it to
msort.py) with some best practices in mind. i will be doing testing away from
the main project from now on so as to not make a mess in my code. I have also
started using git versioning for the same purpose. i need to check if this
program can take input when not focused. i need to check if there is an easy
way for me to edit tags on files. i need to check and see if tags are
standardized at all across OS's.
