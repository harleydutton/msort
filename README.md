# msort
Python media player that sorts files

the goal is to be able to play a fullscreen game with all the normal support
you would expect from a media player except a GUI. if i include one it will be
incredibly minimal. in addition I want to be able to sort my music into
different folders with a keypress or two without leaving my game. I will
probably end up using the F-keys or some other group of infrequently used keys.
basic functionality is present for text to speech, loading, playing, and
pausing songs.
