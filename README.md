#Description
mSort is a custom media player I have written in python to include some custom features I was not able to find in commercially available media players.

#Common features (to be) included
	* keeping a viewable, scrollable list of the music in [some_folder(s)]
	* having buttons and hotkeys for common actions: play/pause,prev,next,and volume
	* shuffle mode
	* some way to specify a music folder

#Custom features
	* tracking how many times songs are skipped
	* some way to mark songs as damaged
	* sync this metadata to google drive for use across devices
	* some minimal UI that receives input when other apps are focused

#Things I might add
	* machine assisted equalization (track volume)
	* track plays as well as skips
	* non-shuffle mode
